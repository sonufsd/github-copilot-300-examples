## 10. Advanced Practice: Scenario-Based and Practical Questions

1. **Scenario:** You are working on a sensitive project and Copilot suggests a code snippet that looks like it came from a public repository. What steps should you take before using it?

   - Review the code for security and licensing issues.
   - Check if the code matches any open-source license requirements.
   - Refactor or rewrite the code if necessary to avoid copyright issues.

2. **Scenario:** Copilot is not providing suggestions in your Python file, but works in JavaScript files. What troubleshooting steps should you follow?

   - Check if Copilot is enabled for Python in VS Code settings.
   - Ensure your Python file is saved with the correct extension (.py).
   - Restart VS Code and check your internet connection.
   - Update the Copilot extension if needed.

3. **Practical:** Demonstrate how to use Copilot to generate a unit test for a function in JavaScript.

   - Write a comment above your function: `// Write a unit test for addNumbers()`
   - Start typing the test function and accept Copilot’s suggestion.

4. **Scenario:** You want Copilot to stop suggesting code for a specific language only. How do you configure this?

   - Go to VS Code settings.
   - Search for Copilot settings and disable it for the specific language.

5. **Practical:** How can you use comments to improve the relevance of Copilot’s suggestions?

   - Write clear, descriptive comments about the function or logic you want.
